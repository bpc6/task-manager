## Task Manager

## Project Description
Create a basic command-line task manager application using C++ that allows users to perform basic operations on tasks. This project will help you practice OOP concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and basic I/O.

## Requirements

1. Create a `Task` class with the following attributes:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Due date
    - Status (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed)

2. Implement a menu-driven interface that allows users to:
    - Add a new task
    - View all tasks
    - Update the status of a task
    - Remove a task
    - Save tasks to a file
    - Load tasks from a file

3. Ensure that your program handles task data using a collection of `Task` objects. You can use a data structure like a vector or list to manage the tasks.

4. When saving and loading tasks to/from a file, use a simple text-based file format, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or plain text.

5. Implement basic error handling to account for user input errors, like trying to update a task that doesn't exist or attempting to load from a non-existent file.

## Bonus Features (optional)

If you complete the basic requirements and have more time, consider adding some of the following features:

1. Task prioritization (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
2. Sorting tasks based on attributes like due date or priority.
3. Task categories or labels.
4. Due date reminders.

## Learning Objectives:

- Define and implement a class (Task) with appropriate attributes and methods.
- Use object-oriented principles like encapsulation to manage the internal state of the Task class.
- Utilize a collection of objects to store and manipulate data.
- Implement basic file I/O for saving and loading data.
- Develop a menu-driven user interface.
- Handle user input and provide error handling.

This project will help you gain practical experience with OOP principles in C++ and improve your problem-solving skills. Additionally, it can serve as a foundation for more complex projects as you continue to advance your C++ programming skills.
